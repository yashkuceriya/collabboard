TIGHT INTRODUCTION (30–45 seconds)
-----------------------------------
Use this first. Then walk through features in a structured way.

"CollabBoard is a real-time collaborative whiteboard for teams who need to
think visually and move fast — brainstorming, onboarding, retrospectives,
and especially practice for technical interviews.

Who it's for: Anyone running workshops, product teams doing retros, and
candidates prepping for system-design or coding interviews. The differentiator
is the interview board: you get a dedicated board mode and an AI that acts like
an interviewer — it helps you break down problems, suggests what to draw
(boxes for services, arrows for data flow), asks clarifying questions, and
points out what you might be missing. So you're not just drawing alone; you're
practicing with structure.

Why it exists: Whiteboards are great for thinking out loud, but setting up
templates and keeping everyone in sync is friction. CollabBoard gives you
real-time collaboration (cursors, presence, instant sync), frames and
connectors so structure is clear, and an AI that can generate useful layouts
from a single prompt — like 'Create an onboarding plan for a new sales hire'
or 'Set up a retrospective with What Went Well, What Didn't, Action Items.'
The value is obvious from the start: you open a board, you know who's there,
and you can either collaborate live or use the AI to get a structured canvas
in seconds."

ONE-LINER (for README or first slide)
--------------------------------------
"CollabBoard is a real-time collaborative whiteboard with an AI assistant —
built for teams and for interview prep, with structured templates and
multi-user sync so the value is obvious from the start."

STRUCTURED FEATURE WALK (after the intro)
-----------------------------------------
Present in this order so the narrative is clear.

1. Core value (what you just said): Teams + interview prep; AI that generates
   useful, structured output (onboarding, retros, SWOT, user journeys).

2. Real-time collaboration: Multi-user cursors, presence (who's online),
   instant object sync. Same board, same view — no refresh needed.

3. AI agent: Natural-language commands. Creation (stickies, shapes, frames),
   manipulation (move, resize, color), layout (grids, spacing), and complex
   templates (SWOT, retrospective, user journey, kanban). Single prompt →
   clean layout via createTemplate.

4. Interview mode: Dedicated board type and AI behavior — interviewer-style
   prompts, step-by-step breakdown, suggestions for what to draw, clarifying
   questions. Strong differentiator; anchor the story here when you mention
   "who it's for."

5. Canvas and UX: Infinite pan/zoom, connectors with clear targets, frames
   (group and move with children), rotation, freehand. So it feels like a
   real whiteboard, not a toy.

6. Sharing and access: Boards you own, boards shared with you (invite by
   email), leave board without affecting others. Google auth and email auth.

7. Technical depth (if asked): Postgres as source of truth, Supabase
   Realtime for sync and cursors, LWW for conflicts, AI writing to the same
   data layer so everyone sees AI output in real time.

REMINDER
--------
- Start with: what it is, who it's for, why it exists.
- Lead with interview board + AI so the value is obvious from the start.
- Then walk through features in a structured way (value → collaboration →
  AI → interview mode → canvas → sharing).
