# Miro & Figma as UI Reference

When changing or adding UI (canvas, selection, tools, panels, text editing), use **Miro** and **Figma** as the primary reference for look and behavior.

## What to emulate

- **Selection**: Single thin outline (1px), no double borders. Small, subtle resize handles (e.g. white/dark fill with thin colored stroke) that don’t dominate the canvas.
- **Canvas chrome**: Minimal. No floating boxes or toolbars around the selection unless the user explicitly opens a panel (e.g. “Edit” / format panel). Avoid auto-opening panels on select.
- **Text / caret**: Thin, 1px-style caret in stickies and code blocks. Good contrast for text and selection; no oversized or faint cursor.
- **Empty state & tools**: Clean, uncluttered toolbars and hints. Quick actions and templates presented simply (e.g. central card with clear actions).
- **Overall**: Calm, minimal UI so the board content is the focus. Match interaction patterns (select → single outline + handles; edit → cursor at start, thin caret; no extra floating UI unless requested).

## When implementing

- Prefer one thin selection border and small handles over thick borders and large handles.
- Prefer opening panels on explicit user action (e.g. “Edit”) over opening on every selection.
- Keep cursor/caret thin and readable; avoid resetting the cursor after the user has started typing.
- For new features (tools, sharing, formatting), ask: “How would Miro or Figma show this?” and align with that level of simplicity and clarity.
