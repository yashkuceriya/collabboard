# CollabBoard — Video Demo Walkthrough

Use this as a read-along walkthrough for your video demo. Start with the **Interview Board**, then move through **Dashboard**, **Normal Board**, **Canvas & Tools**, **AI**, **Collaboration**, and **Sharing**.

---

## 1. Interview Board (start here)

**What it is:** A dedicated board type where the AI acts like an interviewer: it helps you break down problems, suggests what to draw, and asks clarifying questions. Best for technical interview prep.

**How to show it:**

1. **Sign in** (or sign up) on the auth page. You can use **Continue with Google** or email/password.
2. On the **Boards** dashboard, click the green **+ Interview Board** button.
3. A new interview board opens. You’ll see:
   - **Top bar:** Board name (click to rename), **Interview** badge, **AI**, **Chat**, **History**, theme, presence, and user menu.
   - **Bottom toolbar (interview-only):** Select, Sticky, Pen, Eraser, Text, Rectangle, Circle, Line, Connector, Frame, plus **Templates** (System Design / Algorithm), **Code block**, **Clear board**, and a **timer** (start/pause/reset, optional presets).
4. Click **AI** to open the AI panel. The AI is in “interviewer” mode: you can say things like “I want to practice system design for a URL shortener” and it will guide you (e.g. suggest drawing components, asking clarifying questions).
5. Use the **interview toolbar** to add a **System Design** or **Algorithm** template, or insert a **Code block** for coding questions. Use **Pen** to draw, **Sticky** and **Shapes** for structure, **Connector** to link components.
6. Optionally use the **timer** for timed practice, then **Clear board** when you want to start over.

**Key message:** Interview boards are the main differentiator — dedicated mode, interviewer-style AI, and tools (templates, code block, timer) built for prep.

## 2. Dashboard (Boards list)

**What it is:** The home screen where you see all your boards (owned and shared), create new ones, and start from templates.

**How to show it:**

1. Click the **CollabBoard** logo (or **← Boards** from a board) to go to the dashboard.
2. **Header:** “Boards” title, subtitle “X owned · Y shared with you”, and two buttons:
   - **+ New Board** — normal whiteboard.
   - **+ Interview Board** — interview-mode board.
3. **Start from a template:** Five template cards — **Kanban**, **SWOT**, **Retrospective**, **User Journey**, **Pros & Cons**. Clicking one creates a new board and opens the AI panel with that template’s prompt (e.g. “Create a kanban board with To Do, In Progress, Done”).
4. **Tabs:** **All Boards**, **Starred (n)**, **Interview (n)**, **Recent (n)**. Switch to show only starred, only interview boards, or recently opened.
5. **View & search:** Grid/List toggle for board cards; **Search boards…** to filter by name.
6. **Board cards (grid):** Each card shows a colored strip, live preview, board name, **Interview** or **Shared** tag, star, date. **Hover** to see actions: **Star**, **Share**, **Rename**, **Delete** (or **Leave** for shared boards). Click a card to open the board.
7. **Empty states:** If a tab has no boards (e.g. Starred, Recent), a short message explains what to do (e.g. “Star a board to see it here”, “Open a board to see it here”).

**Key message:** One place for all boards, quick create (blank or from template), and easy filtering (tabs + search).

---

## 3. Normal Board & top bar

**What it is:** A standard collaborative whiteboard with full toolbar, AI, board chat, and version history.

**How to show it:**

1. From the dashboard, click **+ New Board** (or open any non-interview board).
2. **Top bar (left):** **← Boards** (back to dashboard), board name (click to rename).
3. **Top bar (right):**
   - **Clear board** (only when board has at least one element) — clears the whole board after confirmation.
   - **Share** — invite by email (Editor/Viewer) or copy share link.
   - **AI** — open AI assistant panel.
   - **Chat** — board chat with collaborators.
   - **History** — version snapshots and restore.
   - Theme switcher (light / dark / system).
   - **Online** indicator and presence (avatars of others on the board).
   - User menu (Profile, Sign out).

**Key message:** Same real-time collaboration and AI as interview boards, with the full toolset and clear board / share / history.

## 4. Canvas & tools

**What it is:** Infinite canvas with pan/zoom and tools for stickies, shapes, text, frames, connectors, and freehand.

**How to show it:**

1. **Pan & zoom:**
   - **Mouse:** Drag empty space to pan. Scroll to zoom. **Shift + scroll** to pan horizontally.
   - **Zoom controls** (bottom-left or similar): **−**, **100%**, **+** for zoom level.
2. **Bottom toolbar (normal board):**
   - **Select (V)** — select elements, drag to move, drag selection box (marquee).
   - **Sticky (N)** — click to add a sticky note.
   - **Rectangle (R), Circle (O), Line (L)** — draw shapes.
   - **Text (T)** — add a text block.
   - **Frame (F)** — draw a frame to group elements; elements inside move with the frame.
   - **Connect (A)** — click two shapes to connect with an arrow; you can select a connector and change its color or delete it from the mini-toolbar.
   - **Draw (P)** — freehand pen.
   - **Eraser (E)** — click an element to remove it.
3. **Selection:**
   - Click an element to select it. **Format panel** (right) lets you change color, font size, etc. for the selected type.
   - **Mini-toolbar** above the element: **Edit** (inline text/sticky), **Duplicate**, **Front/Back**, **Delete** (or press Delete/Backspace). For **connectors**, the mini-toolbar also has **Color** swatches and **Delete**.
   - **Multi-select:** Marquee (drag with Select tool) or Ctrl/Cmd+click; then move, duplicate, or delete as a group.
4. **Rotation:** Selected shapes/stickies show a **rotation handle** above the element; drag to rotate.

**Key message:** Figma/Miro-style canvas: smooth pan/zoom, full toolset, and clear selection/editing (including connectors and rotation).

## 5. AI assistant

**What it is:** An in-board AI that creates and edits content from natural language (stickies, shapes, frames, templates, bulk stickies, summaries).

**How to show it:**

1. Click **AI** in the top bar to open the AI panel.
2. **Interview board:** The AI is in interviewer mode — suggest a scenario (e.g. “Practice system design for a chat app”) and show how it guides you (questions, suggestions to draw, etc.).
3. **Normal board:** Show template-style prompts, for example:
   - “Set up a retrospective board with What went well, What to improve, and Action items.”
   - “Create a SWOT analysis with four quadrants.”
   - “Build a user journey map with 5 stages.”
   - “Create a kanban board with To Do, In Progress, and Done.”
4. After the AI creates content, the board updates in real time. You can **zoom to fit** the new content (if the app supports it) or pan to see it.
5. Mention that the AI can also: add single stickies/shapes, move and resize elements, change colors, create connectors, summarize the board onto a sticky, and do bulk creation (e.g. 50–500 stickies for stress testing).

**Key message:** One prompt can produce a full, structured layout (retro, SWOT, kanban, etc.); on interview boards, the AI doubles as an interviewer.

## 6. Real-time collaboration & presence

**What it is:** Multiple users on the same board at once; you see their cursors and edits live.

**How to show it:**

1. **Presence:** Top bar shows an **Online** indicator and **Presence bar** (avatars of others on the board). If you have two browsers (or incognito + normal), sign in as different users and open the same board to see two cursors.
2. **Live updates:** Add or move something in one tab; the other tab updates immediately. Board state is stored in the backend, so when everyone leaves and comes back, the board is still there.

**Key message:** Real-time cursors and sync; the board is the source of truth for everyone.

---

## 7. Board chat

**What it is:** A chat room for the current board so collaborators can talk without leaving the canvas.

**How to show it:**

1. Click **Chat** in the top bar to open the board chat panel.
2. Type a message and send. Messages are tied to the board and visible to everyone with access.
3. You can have **AI** and **Chat** panels open at the same time (they sit side by side).

**Key message:** In-context discussion next to the board and the AI.

---

## 8. Version history

**What it is:** Snapshots of the board over time; you can restore an older version.

**How to show it:**

1. Click **History** in the top bar to open the version history panel.
2. List of snapshots (e.g. by time or label). Click a snapshot to see what the board looked like (if the UI supports preview).
3. **Restore** (or similar) loads that snapshot back onto the board (elements replaced by the snapshot state).

**Key message:** Safe to experiment; you can always revert to a previous version.

---

## 9. Sharing & access

**What it is:** Invite others by email (Editor or Viewer) or share a link so they can join the board.

**How to show it:**

1. Click **Share** in the top bar (on a board you own).
2. **Invite by email:** Enter email, choose **Editor** or **Viewer**, send invite. The recipient gets access when they sign in with that email.
3. **Share link:** Copy a link that allows join as Editor or Viewer (or view-only). Anyone with the link can open the board (and sign in if required).
4. **Dashboard:** Shared boards appear in “X shared with you”. You can **Leave** a shared board so it disappears from your list without deleting it for others.

**Key message:** Flexible sharing (email + link, Editor/Viewer) and clean “leave board” for your own list.

---

## 10. Profile & settings

**What it is:** Set your display name and avatar (color/emoji) used on boards and in presence.

**How to show it:**

1. Click your **avatar** in the top bar → **Profile**.
2. **Profile page:** Email (read-only), First name, Last name, **Avatar color** (swatch grid), **Avatar emoji** (optional). Click **Save**.
3. Your name/initials and avatar color (or emoji) show in the presence bar and on your cursor for collaborators.

**Key message:** Simple profile so collaborators see who’s who.

---

## 11. Theme & auth

**What it is:** Light/dark/system theme and sign-in/sign-up.

**How to show it:**

1. **Theme:** Use the **sun / moon / monitor** icons in the header to switch **Light**, **Dark**, or **System**.
2. **Auth:** Sign out via the user menu. From the auth page you can sign in with **Google** or **email/password**, or switch to **Sign up** to create an account. After sign-up you can sign in; after sign-in you’re taken to the dashboard.

**Key message:** Theme follows system or your choice; auth supports Google and email.
